# Diabetes Prediction Project

Performing Data Cleaning, EDA, and Supervised Learning on the Diabetes Prediction Project. Goal here is to predict the Occurance of Diabetes for patients based on a set of predictors, which generally includes information of BMI, blood pressure, and other health indicators which can be used to classify diabetes. We will create models for the Health Care professions with the highest Accuracy (We got the score of 0.9724) and a model with higher time efficiency at the cost of some reduced accuracy for the Businesses which needs also to Classify the patients in order to create more personalized recommendation for the medicines, tests, or any other similar offering. (Here we got a model with score of 0.97185 with only around 25% time taken as compared to the best model)

This repo has PPT for the Presentation, Jupyter Notebook, and the Data Set. Source of the dataset is Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
